# Task 2B Output
## Objective of the Task:
The objective of this task is to develop a digital design application by writing a C program using Leafpad in a Linux environment, compiling and running the code using GCC to verify its functionality, and then generating the corresponding assembly code using a RISC-V compiler. 
The RISC-V assembly code will be executed using the Spike simulator, and the output from Spike will be compared with the output generated by GCC to ensure consistency and correctness of the program across different platforms. 
This process aims to validate the functionality of the digital design both at the C and assembly levels.

## Digital Design Application:
### Maximum & Minimum Number Detector:
The **Maximum & Minimum Number Detector** is a digital design application that identifies the largest and smallest numbers from a given set of inputs. 
This application is crucial in systems where real-time data processing is needed, such as sensor data analysis, decision-making circuits, or optimization algorithms. 
By comparing multiple inputs, the design detects and outputs both the maximum and minimum values, providing an essential function in data filtering, control systems, and digital signal processing.

#### 1. Writing a C Program to Find Maximum & Minimum of 5 User given Numerical Inputs:

***Figure 4. Compiled C Code in Spike Simulator***
### Thus, the outputs compiled by GCC and the Spike Simulator are the same! 
### Hence, Verified!
